# About Dani Akash

## Who Am I?

Hello! I'm Dani Akash, a passionate JavaScript Developer based in San Francisco, CA. I love turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions.

## My Journey

I discovered my passion for coding during my undergraduate years at the University of Technology. After obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2016, I joined NextGen Solutions as a JavaScript Developer. In mid-2020, I moved on to WebSolutions Inc., where I currently work as a Senior JavaScript Developer.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is more than just a programming language to me. It's a tool that allows me to craft interactive, dynamic, and beautiful user experiences. Its versatility, from front-end frameworks like React to back-end solutions like Node.js, makes it a one-stop language for all things web development.
